# Risk Generalities

```
"Every security rule or recommendation must be accompanied by its justification
in order to not be rejected or by-passed"

Trusted networks zone => networks on which we master the security

Never use a USB key found in a car park...

Users awarness remains essential.

The strength of the break is equal to the weakest channel passing through
```

## DICP
_**D**isponibility_ : Availability

_**I**ntegrity_

_**C**onfidentiality_

_**P**roof_ : Traceability

## Risk Concepts

1. Reduce the probability to see threats become a reality

2. Restrict the associated damages

3. Allow to recover to usual functioning within satisfactory
costs and time limits.

## Sniffing
Consists to catch  a traffic image of the network.

>For the hacker, the goal is to get information to prepare the attack

/!\ If someone is sniffing, he can see in `plaintext` all the messages using telnet, http, etc...

## TCP spoofing

In TCP header, there are 6 bits to influence the TCP behavior :

URG - __ACK__ - PSH - RST - __SYN__ - FIN

![TCP header](https://github.com/godfreybrew/CybersecurityMaster/blob/master/img/tcp_header.gif)

TCP uses a Three-way handshake.

![Three-way handshake](https://github.com/godfreybrew/CybersecurityMaster/blob/master/img/3wayhs.PNG)

1. The first packet is a SYNC. The sequence number is A.
2. Answering  a SYNC-ACK packet. The sequence number is B and the acknowledgment number is (A+1).
3. Sequence number A+1 and acknowledgment number B+1

The hacker replaces his IP address by an other source address that he wants to spoof. The victim will send its answer to the spoofed source address indicated in the SYN packet sent by the hacker.
This answer SYN+ACK contains the sequence number chosen by the victim that the hacker needs to continue his attack and send data to the victim.

Then there are 2 cases : 

* TCP spoofing on the same sub-network.
By sniffing, hacker may observe victim answers even if these answers are not for his destination. The hacker will see the sequence number that the victim will propose in its answer so he will be able to construct a correct ACK packet to establish the connexion

* TCP spoofing on being externally to the victim or usurped machine sub-network. The hacker as to guess the next sequence number. This one is coded on 32 bits. 2^32 possibilities...

## SYN flooding Attack

SYN Flood attack corresponds to a client who doesnâ€™t answer to the SYN-ACK.
The goal of the attack is to fill the queue on the server where partially
established connections are stored.

A way to counter this attack is to delete partially connections after a delay.

## DOS & DDOS
**D**enial **O**f **S**ervice & **D**istributed **D**enial **O**f **S**ervice

A DOS consits to put down a service or a system.
A DDOS is a DOS with multiples equipments.

## Botnets

__Explanation__
A bot is an single infected machine, under control by untrusted person

A _Botnet_ : a network of bots working together

A _bot-herder_ : a the bot operator (i.e. bad human)

_Command & Control server_ : the botnet brain

Botnets are using to do DDOS, spamming, steal passwords,  

__How to counter them__
* _Decapitation_ ! Separate the bots from the _Command & Control servers_. Without intructions from a server, bots can't change their code to sneak, or target a new victim.

* _Defend !_
	* Preventing infections
	* Find infected devices
	* Limit attack perimeter
	* limiting damage


## Keyloggers

Trojan variant intercepting keystrokes. 2 types :
* __Hardware__ - Install between the keyboard and the system. Wicked needs to gain physical access.
* __Software__ 
	* Freeware, easy to find on internet
	* Commercial, sell in US to spy family

/!\ Keyloggers can steal all confidential informations : credit cards, password, identifiers, etc...
Storage or send datas to malicious people.

__Counter-measures__

* Keyloggers remain trojan and can be fight as a virus. So keep your Anti-virus updated : Signatures basis must be keep up-to-date.
* Firewall because if the keylogger exports datas collected through the network, the firewall can detect a unusual/non-conform port used.
* Protect the physical access & Search for keyloggers around keyboard.
* Keyloggers focus on password so use tokens, digital certificate, biometric stuff, etc.
* And users awarness remains essential. __Users awarness remains essential.__ U-s-e-r-s a-w-a-r-n-e... OK you get it.
